spaces
======

Spaces aims to provide a way of defining the shape of a developer's workspace in a declarative manner.
A developer's workspace is understood as the environment (variables), software installed, repositories present, etc, that the developer needs for a particular project.

Spaces will provide software developers a way of sharing workspaces as well as their building blocks.
